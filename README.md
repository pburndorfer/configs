# configs
This github repo is containing a variation of config files that I'm using on my own Linux setups.

Each config has it's own subdirectory with the name of the service or the corresponding name of the Linux directory.  
Besides that, each folder locates a readme file which tries to explain what can be found inside the subfolder.

Get inspired and have fun!
